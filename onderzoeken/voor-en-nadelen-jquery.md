# Voor- en nadelen jQuery

Pro's

Eliminates a lot of cross browser javascript issues
Can perform complicated Javascript operations in little code
Can easily add Ajax functionality to app
Has built in UI and effects libraries
Con's

Overhead of adding extra javascript to page
Learning curve may not be short for some developers

I would say jQuery learning curve is the shortest compared to all other JS libraries. One of the reasons for the jQuery popularity.

I would agree. But at the same time, maybe to short. jQuery certainly help out a lot, but may hinder developers to learn true javascript.

The only thing will be the execution time overhead that jQuery adds to load its files and execute its functions, but compared to the Pro of coding cross browser compatible JavaScript it is nothing.

Also compared to other JavaScript libraries jQuery is one of the fastest and smallest out there. Their community is huge and you can easily find support and good documentation.

Pros:

Large community
Useful for selecting and iterating over sets of DOM nodes
Eliminates some inconsistencies between browsers
Makes it easy for inexperienced JavaScript developers to do relatively complex scripting tasks
Cons:

Regular updates that change existing behaviour
Some confusing fundamental API methods (e.g. attr() method: what exactly does it do? It certainly blurs the line between attributes and properties)
Encourages "chaining", which leads to code that is difficult to debug: in a long chain of jQuery method calls, there's nowhere to put logging statements, so you need a full-on debugger
Short list of supported browsers
A general point about general purpose libraries: they encourage developers not to attempt to understand the underlying problems that the libraries try to solve, leading to a tendency to think of the library as being magical and to use it for absolutely everything
Adds 70K of JavaScript to every page where it's used when often a few bytes of non-jQuery code would do
Performance is generally much slower than the equivalent (well thought-through) non-jQuery code
Quality of plug-ins is very variable

Advantages
Ease of use
This is pretty much the main advantage of using JQuery, it is a lot more easy to use compared to standard javascript and other javascript libraries. Apart from simple syntax, it also requires much less lines of code to achieve the same feature in comparison.

Large library
JQuery enables you to perform hordes of functions in comparison to other Javascript libraries.

Strong opensource community. (Several jQuery plugins available)
JQuery, while relatively new, has a following that religiously devote their time to develop and enhance the functionality of JQuery. Thus there are hundreds of prewritten plugins available for download to instantly speed up your development process. Another advantage behind this is the efficiency and security of the script.

Great documentation and tutorials
The JQuery website has a comprehensive documentation and tutorials to get even an absolute beginner in programming to get the ball rolling with this library.

Ajax support
JQuery lets you develop Ajax templates with ease, Ajax enables a sleeker interface where actions can be performed on pages without requiring the entire page to be reloaded. A pretty but simple example of this can be seen above the fold on HowToRefinanceYourMortgage.net.

Disadvantages
Functionality maybe limited
While JQuery has an impressive library in terms of quantity, depending on how much customization you require on your website, functionality maybe limited thus using raw javascript maybe inevitable in some cases.

JQuery javascript file required
The JQuery javascript file is required to run JQuery commands, while the size of this file is relatively small (25-100KB depending on server), it is still a strain on the client computer and maybe your web server as well if you intend to host the JQuery script on your own web server.

jQuery is the biggest open-source, CSS3 compliant, cross-browser, JavaScript library available. What makes jQuery stand out is its simplicity and ability create Flash-like animations that are viewable on iOS, which doesn’t work with Flash. The popularity of jQuery is growing quickly, so we think it’s important you know the pros and cons of using it.

Pros

The biggest upside to jQuery is its simplicity. It takes only a little bit of programming knowledge to create crowd pleasing animations. It is also incredibly flexible because jQuery allows users to add plug-ins. If you don’t know how to do it in CSS, jQuery can help you.

It is also a very fast solution to your problems. While there may be “better” solutions, jQuery and its development team work to make sure you can implement jQuery quickly and effectively, which saves money. Those in the open Source software community support jQuery because it has great technical support, interacts well with other types of code, supports plug-ins and makes basic animation as easy as can be.

Open source software means quick growth and the freedom of developers to provide the best service possible without corporate red tape.



Cons
Open source software does have some problems however. There is no set standard amongst providers, which means if you or the developer do not have the money, time or ability to fix issues, you may never find a solution if you have a problem. Also, frequent updates mean community members are also unlikely to provide solutions.
There are also many versions of jQuery available right now and some are less compatible than others.
Also, jQuery’s lightweight interface may lead to problems in the future. Not being able to actually code can lead to many problems in implementation. Not knowing how to program means not knowing how to fix issues that arrive with jQuery and it doesn’t pick up the slack for you. While jQuery is seemingly easy and impressive, making it actually work can be much more troublesome. To make jQuery work, you have to keep up with community developments and realistically understand your skill level.



jQuery is  slower than CSS in many cases. Its simplicity is its curse, as it is not meant for client-side interactions. If you misuse jQuery, you get code that multiplies and multiplies until it is unmanageable, which means a few simple lines of code can quickly make maintaining your site a nightmare. The community is working to fix this issue but for now it is a very real problem.

Conclusion

While jQuery is easy, know if you can handle it before trying. It is meant to simplify tasks for skilled programmers and not to be used as a crutch for beginners. While the less experienced may be able to make jQuery work for them, they will most likely need a lot of assistance.

jQuery has been abused by inexperienced developers....and....the anti jquery moment is overhyped by blog authors looking to capitalize on a little extra adsense revenue by throwing out a clickbaity "shock" title.

You should learn both, you should learn why you're using jquery, so that way it's not a crutch. jQuery isn't that bad, plus if you pull jquery from google's cdn, there is a very high probability that the user already has jQuery cached in their browser from another site, so the cost of jquery on yours would/could me almost nothing.

"jQuery and its cousins are great, and by all means use them if it makes it easier to develop your application.

If you're developing a library on the other hand, please take a moment to consider if you actually need jQuery as a dependency. Maybe you can include a few lines of utility code, and forgo the requirement. If you're only targeting more modern browsers, you might not need anything more than what the browser ships with.

At the very least, make sure you know what jQuery is doing for you, and what it's not. Some developers believe that jQuery is protecting us from a great demon of browser incompatibility when, in truth, post-IE8, browsers are pretty easy to deal with on their own."

So it's not suggesting that JQuery is bad to use, but to make sure you're using it for the right reasons. So as said, learning both avoids it being a crutch at least.

But I have been recently using it for a project at work, (although not a programming job, but I made a suggestion, people liked it, now I am coding it to their specifications) and it is proving to be very useful to me. I am thinking if I did it vanilla, it would be going the long way round for some things I wanted to do and would take me longer to develop and given my time constraint, JQuery has been brilliant. But I would also class myself as inexperienced, as I am working still through the Tech Degree anyway.
