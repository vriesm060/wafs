# Advantages and disadvantages of jQuery

jQuery is a widely used Javascript library that is easy to use and can be of great help to beginning developers, but there are some flaws too. Here is a list of jQuery pros and cons.

## Pros

* jQuery eliminates a lot of cross browser javascript issues
* With jQuery you can perform complicated Javascript operations with a view lines of code
* The jQuery learning curve is very short. It is easy to learn for beginning developers
* The jQuery community is big and you can easily find support
* jQuery makes it easy for inexperienced Javascript developers to do relatively complex scripting tasks
* jQuery is incredibly flexible because it allows users to add plug-ins

## Cons

* Overhead of adding extra javascript to page
* jQuery may hinder developers to learn true javascript
* jQuery features regular updates that change existing behaviour, which might lead to complications
* jQuery encourage developers not to attempt to understand the underlying problems that the libraries try to solve, which can lead to people not understanding the fundamental Javascript underneath it
* Performance is generally much slower than the equivalent non-jQuery code
* jQuery encourages "chaining", which leads to code that is difficult to debug

## Conclusion

While jQuery is easy to use, it is not meant to be used as an alternative to Javascript. It is meant to simplify tasks for skilled programmers and knowledge of Vanilla Javascript is still needed.

If you're developing using a library, like jQuery, you have to consider if you actually need it. Maybe you only need to include a few lines of code. That way, using the entire library is not a good idea.
